    <h3>
        alt-J, stylized as ∆, are an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds, by Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass),
        Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Thom Sonny Green (drums) and Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals).
        <br />
        <br />
        The band's debut album An Awesome Wave was released in May 2012 in Europe and September 2012 in the United States, and
        won the 2012 British Mercury Prize. Gwil Sainsbury amicably departed the band in early 2014.
        Their second album, This Is All Yours, was released on 22 September 2014 and went straight to UK number one.
        As a replacement for Sainsbury, Cameron Knight became a supporting member for alt-J's live shows, playing guitar,
        bass and sampler.
        <br />
        <br />
        The band's symbol is the capital letter delta, Δ, which is traditionally used in scientific study to indicate
        "change" or "difference". The ∆ symbol can be typed on an Apple Mac with the key sequence Alt+J (on certain keyboard layouts).
        The cover art of their debut album An Awesome Wave shows an overhead view of the largest river delta in the world, the Ganges.
        alt-J were previously known as "Daljit Dhaliwal" and then "Films", but were later forced to change to "alt-J" because
        an American band called "The Films" already existed.
